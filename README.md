### Project Title

Molecular Prediction

### Problem Statement

Predict molecular properties based on the structure of molecules, including properties that have not been previously calculated.

### Working Prototype

Description of the prototype:

- An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained to predict molecular properties.
- A Python-based web application for easy interaction.
- Users can import datasets into the web app to predict molecular properties and compare them with previously calculated properties.
- Required molecular descriptors for prediction:
- - dnAB	dnCCDB	dnQC	g_CH3	g_CH2_linear	g_OH	g_O_linear	g_O_ring	Ketone_linear	Ketone_ring	Aldehyde	Ester_linear	g_CH_linear	g_CHdb_linear	g_CHdb_ring	g_CH2db_linear	g_CH_ring	g_CH2_ring	Carboxylic_acid	Mod_Leiden

### Installation

- Review the requierements.txt file.

### Usage

- Import a dataset to predict the properties

### Future Improvements

- Include more properties
- Show the UI of the Model trained and allow the customer to change the architecture.
